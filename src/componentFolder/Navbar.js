  // PPI (not pixels per inch):
  // Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are powerful medications that significantly reduce stomach acid by blocking the proton pumps in stomach lining cells, used for conditions like GERD, ulcers, and erosive esophagitis, with common examples including Omeprazole (Prilosec) and Esomeprazole (Nexium). They work by permanently inactivating the acid-producing pumps, requiring the stomach to generate new ones, and while effective and generally safe short-term, long-term use needs monitoring due to potential side effects like headaches or diarrhea.
